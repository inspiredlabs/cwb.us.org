# Clowns Without Borders US

## SCOPE OF WORK

### Naomi's risk assesment requirements

Firstly Naomi, please let me help ensure you get the best value for money. Following your `Budget Review`, I aim to be the most reliable & accountable supplier:

- I am trustworthy & flexible.
- I can guarantee **meeting your deadline** and you'll be able to shape the end-result too.
- I have an **innovative proposal** and â€“ I'll help as-and-when things change because that's what maintainence is really about.

### A reliable & accountable supplier

In a perfect world, your bandwidth should be focusing making business decisions about your charity â€“Â rather than thinking about technology risk!

Technically, the work I will deliver is informed by prior design and development already working for [CWB, UK](https://cwb.org.uk/), National Geographic and similar organisations.

In general they prioritse a responsible tech-partner over cost, here's one of my recent [reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/users/637cf2765bc60600112957fc) for example.

**What this RFP does not cover**: how do we both know we've covered everything? Don't worry. When you work with me it's ok to change your mind and develop your idea!

> I can make things fit your needs because I have designed my own platform: _flexibility_ is where I shine.

### Meeting your deadline

ðŸš€ **[CWB.US.ORG](https://www.cwb.us.org/) is ready when you are!**
