# SCOPE OF WORK

## Naomi's risk assessment requirements

Firstly, I have studied your `Budget Review` and want to help you get the best value for money, while being flexible and trustworthy:

- I am a reliable & accountable supplier.
- I can guarantee **meeting your deadline** and you'll be able to shape the end-result too.
- I have an **innovative proposal** and – can help _as-and-when things change_ because that's the inherent advantage of a maintainence budget.

## A reliable & accountable supplier

In a perfect world, your focus should be making business decisions about your charity – rather than thinking about tech. Here, I aim to derisk technology for you and offer clarification whenever you need it.

## How do we know you'll be able to deliver?

My work is informed by prior design and development for other businesses, including [Clowns Without Borders, UK (**CWB, UK**)](https://cwb.org.uk/), National Geographic and other communication-conscious  organisations. In general, they prioritse a responsible tech-partner over cost.

Just have a look at one of my recent [reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/users/637cf2765bc60600112957fc).

There is no rigid blueprint, **this RFP is just a guide**: _when do we know we've covered everything?_ Don't worry. When you work with me it's ok to change your mind and develop your idea – it's part of the process!

> I can make things fit your needs because I have designed my own platform: _flexibility_ is where I shine.

## Meeting your deadline

🚀 **[CWB.US.ORG](https://www.cwb.us.org/) is ready when you are!**

I aim to use **[CWB.US.ORG](https://www.cwb.us.org/)** as a staging site for development, then perform the migration when you are totally happy.

Behind the scenes [CWB.US.ORG](https://www.cwb.us.org/) is already for you to login! Here is an overview of _some_ of the technologies installed already:

### The Double Diamond Process

> The above might look vauge, but we can use this **Double Diamond** like a map to visualise where we are in the whole process&hellip;

Often, a disproportionate amount of energy is spent on "Deliverables". In reality **Design with Intent** means taking a holistic approach – one that helps us iterate, and one that helps us call other things _finished_,  where appropriate.

![The Double Diamond helps us, like a map to visualise where we are in the whole process](https://www.cwb.us.org/color/double-diamond.webp "The Double Diamond helps us, like a map to visualise where we are in the whole process")

# Maintainence Flexibility

There is no reason to stick to a rigid blueprint as I am happy to help you grow, whatever your demands might be. These incremental tweaks are included in your maintainence budget. And, for peace of mind:

> Maintainence will only happen _after_ migration.

# Information Architecture

What is `Information Architecture`?

> `Information Architecture`, or `IA`: is a way of adding clarity, findability and meaning to disparate, related ideas and is vital for cohesive engagement.

Here, I quickly represent a "day-one" structure to help reimagine the `IA`:

- homepage:
	- impact of our work
  - main `CTA`
  - Why Laughter Matters
  - video (See: `Storytelling` meets `UX` demo)
  - Our Mission
- Partner With Us
- About Us
	- Our Story
	- How we work
	- Annual Reports
- Contact Us
- Blog:
	- `Storytelling` template in use
	- 12 posts (migrated)
	- appropriate video embed (See: `Storytelling` meets `UX` demo).

# Implementation

In a nutshell, I propose delivering the following:

- a CMS + `UAT (User Acceptance Testing)`. I have already done some research to get you up and running that gives you something `Easy to manage` yet, with the flexibility you are looking for.
- Use `Websites we love!` as inspiration: You've told me what works for you – and I have clear ideas how to make this work!
- Mobile First 🥇 – this section will cover graphic communication, layout and `Devices`.
  - Provide a resource conscious `UX`.
  - Use `Graphic Communication` to prioritise the needs of our `Target Audience`.
- Strategically design a Win-Win scenario for our `Target Audience`. Here I'll discuss the design and development stage of the project and what questions we'll need to answer to get the best result.

## CMS + `UAT (User Acceptance Testing)`

Over the past two weeks, I have prepared a CMS that is: `Easy to manage`, `not dependent on a 3rd party developer` and versatile enough for you to `make changes to the menu bar, including menu options, drop down options, and logo`.

This choice is of CMS aims to bring ease-of-use (like `Wordpress`), with the security and speed of next-gen webapps<!-- (if you're technically minded you can think of these as `transitional apps` running on the `JAMstack`) -->.

## I see `Easy to manage` is important to you

In my experience _easy_ often competes with _versatile_. This can be a hard problem to solve for everyone.

However, there are new and emerging ways to make life easier for content producers and editors. For example, AI can produce `Automated SEO Suggestions`. This may sound complicated, but in reality, I have been using AI since 2016 and have a proof-of-concept demo using content from [CWB,&nbsp;UK](https://cwb.org.uk/).

## What is `UAT (User Acceptance Testing)`, and why do we need it?

To be certain the new platform suits your needs – you should try it, before you live with it! `UAT` is the process of trying something out, feedback and training (as required).

Going through things like this helps us strike a balance between: where you need _my professional intervention_ and where you are happy doing things _autonomously_.

I have done some research to get you up and running and on paying your deposit, you can test this platform – and, as always:

> &hellip;if you eventually think this decision isn't right for you, then I can make different suggestions to help meet competing needs-and-wants.

While it's _not_ encouraged after a few months, you can always decide to swap components (like a CMS). This is because I am developing my own flexible platform.

## Use `Websites we love!` as inspiration

| Website: | Noteworthy because: | How we could develop this&hellip; |
| - | -- | --- |
| Charity&nbsp;Water | `Storytelling`: "The Colors of Dirty Water" | A  blog called **_True Colors_**. You can see this demo when you're ready |
| [CWB,&nbsp;UK](https://cwb.org.uk/) | Crisp, impactful `UI` with an emphasis on fundraising | Add video and strategically align business goals with design ambitions |
| Owl & Panther | Immediate clarity of purpose. Compelling, yet minimal publishing | Strike a chord while exercising restraint. <br>Less is more. |
| [Plan C](https://www.weareplanc.org/modules/) | A strong voice. A sophisticated discourse on degrowth. Imprefect, bold graphics. | Leverage the power of `Storytelling`. <br>Match content and graphics. |

## Mobile First 🥇

The layout should meet the goals of our `Target Audience`. This means:

- Provide a resource conscious `UX` (measure this, and aim for 100%).
- Use `Graphic Communication` to prioritise the needs of our `Target Audience`.
- Deliver a strong `Storytelling` experience to meet business goals.

### Provide a resource conscious `UX`

- `Devices` refer to a mix of mobile and desktop from `Apple`, `Android`, `Windows touchscreen` and `Ubuntu`.
- you can steer our device choice too: When you know the `make & model` your fundraising strategy focuses on, I can apply a specific design treatment there.
- Providing a resource conscious `UX` means I aim to score 100% in a `Lighthouse` test. See Scott's work on CWB,&nbsp;UK for what that looks like in practice:

![Scott scores 100% on Google's Lighthouse test](https://www.cwb.us.org/color/nobody-does-it-better.webp "Scott scores 100% on Google's Lighthouse test")


### Graphic Communication

Effective `Graphic Communication` leads to an emotional connection.

A bold visual identity paired with good `Storytelling` and thoughful `Call To Action` helps present your `Brand` in a cohesive way.


#### Visual Identity

An iconic symbol as a logo will improve your `Visual Identity`. Here is a demo of how that might work with your current content. Note how much contrast there is in the video thumbnails:

![Be bold: use contrast](https://www.cwb.us.org/color/social-media.webp "Be bold: use contrast")

![Resopnsive Logo](https://www.cwb.us.org/color/responsive-logo.gif "Resopnsive Logo")
-->

#### Impact language <!-- and `Storytelling` -->

Your `Brand` should have impact across the web, social media, print in a cohesive way.

> Key question: From the current messaging, how do we know what is working well and how do we know what needs updating?

Current `CTA` messaging (Feb. 2023):

- Give Laughter (aka. `Donate`).
- [Current homepage](https://clownswithoutborders.org/donate-clowns-without-borders/): We Bring Laughter Where It's Needed Most
- [Current homepage](https://clownswithoutborders.org/donate-clowns-without-borders/): _Our Mission: Clowns Without Borders (CWB – USA) offers joy and laughter to relieve the suffering of all persons, especially children, who live in areas of crisis including refugee camps, conflict zones and territories in situations of emergency. Vision&hellip;_
- [Buffer](https://clownswithoutborders.start.page/): _Resilience through laughter_
- [Kindful](https://clownswithoutborders.kindful.com/): _Give Laughter_
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CWBUSA): _CWB offers laughter to bring relief to children living in crisis areas. We also seek to raise our society’s awareness of affected populations._
- [Current website donate page](https://clownswithoutborders.org/donate-clowns-without-borders/): _You can make a difference to displaced children. Everyone deserves to laugh._
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/clownswithoutborders.usa/): _Sharing resilience through laughter to bring relief to children living in crisis areas._
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/clownswithoutborders/): _Laughing Matters - where all other resources are scarce, laughter can and should be abundant._
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@clownswithoutbordersusa): No about page.

The solution: Use `Impact Language` and **Repeat, Repeat, Repeat**.

In modern life there is a signal-to-noise problem and it's up to us to filter what people to see. Help people's cognitive load by repeating your `Impact Language`.

> When we strike with our most important ideas – people are more likely to take action.

<!--
2023 `Impact Language` slogans:

> Laughter to bring relief to children living in crisis zones

> Resilience through laughter, where it's needed most

> Give laughter, where it's needed most

-->

#### Define common `CTA`

A good `Call To Action`, or `CTA` will define what you want people to do as they become more aligned with your values and share your goals.

Your `CTA` should remove barriers so people can:

- donate.
- subscribe or share across social media.
- take more complex steps such as `Partner` or begin `Grant Funding`.
- **amplify your excellent reviews**.

As I deep-dived into your online footprint, I noticed you have a lot to manage. It can benefit people's perception to tighten up your `CTA`. This can be done by unifying messaging, layout and thinking about the rest of the `UX`.

> A good example is [Wish](https://wish.org/careers), who use responsive web design cleverly across different display constraints.

#### Storytelling template

People make decisions on an emotional level.

Your stories have already started to connect people to CWB. Now I have read Maggie's work, I expect as we _join-forces_ we'll come up with some cracking content!

By meshing writing and design, we can use:

- `impact language` to help summarise and spread the article.
- descern info boxes that highlight CWB involvement (build on what works from: [Revuelta 2022 feedback](https://www.cwb.us.org/color/feedback.webp)).
- explain the protagonist's struggle and the relationship to CWB's mission (this resonates from the Ukraine post).
- highlight quotes and relatable outcomes.
- specific about how the `Target Audience` should get involved (our `CTA`).

<!--
- Introduce a protagonist of specific interest to the `Target Audience`: introduce this person (or group).
- Describe the problem: have the reader empathise as you sum up the difficulties of their struggle.
- Introduce the solution: explain how CWB became involved and the close ties this situation has with CWB's mission.
- The human impact: write a relatable outcome for the protagonist with quotes.
- `CTA`: be specific about how the `Target Audience` should get involved.
- Conclusion: encourage sharing via social media with `impact language` to help summarise how to spread the article.
- Finally: Thank the reader for their support.

Here's a [method](https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/nonprofit-storytelling-guide) to help people empathise with other's problems:

## Strategically design a Win-Win Scenario for our `Target Audience`

- Credability, check! ✅
- A strong Writer, check! ✅
- An organised Designer, check! ✅
- Strategic business goals – wait a second&hellip; do we need a business plan? Well, not quite! ❌

A Win-Win scenario can be established with the [Double Diamond Process](https://github.com/inspiredlabs/cwb.us.org/blob/master/README.md#the-double-diamond-process) guiding our implementation. There are four phases: **Discover, Define, Develop & Deliver** – by following this pattern we can acheive a loose,  effective business strategy to bind everything together.

## Discover

My approach is to **Design with Intent**. During the initiation phase of a project it's easy to neglect aspects of a project because they remain unclear. The opposite of this is _exuberance_, which can lead to conflicting advice. My aim, is to strike a balance between meaningful progress and considering some decisions out of the scope of my RFP.

Without over-analysing please get me paid & we can put this into practice!

How do we find our `Target Audience`?

It should be safe to say that at this stage, `visitors from organic search & social media` have been fine for `sustainment`. But, even with an awesome content drive, SEO research and a tonne of luck – they might only be able to raise the volume slightly.

We don't want to forget them – but it's worthwhile considering what can happen if we're more ambitious.

### Beyond `sustainment`

#### The `Athlete and the Elderly` design pattern

This design pattern strives to satisfy mixed ability users. It emphasises findability through clear and concise language, a logical layout and accessiblity.

> **Who is who?** Our `Movers & Shakers` are at one end of the spectrum, and `visitors from organic search & social media` define the other

This spectrum represents people's familiarity with charities, and, is a baseline to improve any `sustainment` strategy.

Note how this is different from `Information Architecture`, which brings clarity to the underlying structure of your information. A design pattern on the other hand, is a method of reliably applying that structure to serves different people's needs.

Thinking like this can be used as part of establishing **Win-Win** conditions.

#### Movers & Shakers

- Who are the _Movers & Shakers_ that matter?
  - The goal is to target just 2 or 3 people in the _whole world_ that could make life better!
  - they might be people you know, such as `Grant Funders`, `Partner/Collaborators` or perhaps new `Sponsors` that have specific investment goals.
- eg: [Jumpman](https://wish.org/michael-jordan-gift) celebrates his 60th in style!
  - By making a **$10m** donation to the Make-A-Wish Foundation it's clear that the charity are having impact and trusted to deliver on their promises – great!
  - **More money in = more granted wishes**, their operation effectively _scales_ in proportion to their capacity. Their `Charitable Objectives` get fulfilled in a winner-takes-all feedback loop! As they earn funds, it looks like they can grant more wishes.
  - This makes them highly influential. People looking to donate (to somewhere/anywhere), simply follow because they _are_ a trusted pair of hands.
- Can we write a list of our "Micheal Jordans"?
  - here's a list of [50 people](https://www.businessweekly.co.uk/killer50/killer50-profiles) working in tech in Cambridge, England. Is there a similar list of `Grant Funders` or `Partner/Collaborators` that we can study?
  - &hellip;do we already have a list?
- What do we do with the list?
  - we shape the whole operation around our ability to scale effectively.
  - find ways to have **impact in proportion to investment**.
  - we should focus on a tiny group of _Movers & Shakers_ and develop an experience to capture their imagination and build something next-gen!
  - **&hellip;also** represent our actions clearly so `visitors from organic search & social media` can understand how we are that trusted pair of hands they are looking for.

> Key question: what do we do **already** to serve our existing Movers & Shakers?

##### `Target Audience` segmentation

<!-- ##### `Target Audience` Requirements -->

Concentrating on who we are looking for, it should become clear what our webapp should do for our different `Target Audience`.

Let's break this down, starting with `Grant Funders`.

> Key question: What need or business-case did CWB fulfill for the biggest `Grant Funder`?

> Key question: What need or business-case did CWB fulfill for the most regular `Grant Funders`?

> Key question: where do you normally find `Grant Funders` & interact with them?

> Key question: who are the best `Grant Funders` & why?

> Key question: which `Grant Funders` have repeat funds & why?

> Key question: when `Grant Funders` review our application is there a **special relationship** that helps move the needle in our favour? &hellip;if so, how do we amplify this, improve their experience and do more for them?

`Partner/Collaborators`

> Key question: what are their needs?
