# Clowns Without Borders US

## SCOPE OF WORK

### Naomi's risk assesment requirements

Firstly Naomi, please let me help ensure you get the best value for money. Following your `Budget Review`, I aim to be flexible and trustworthy:

- I am a reliable & accountable supplier.
- I can guarantee **meeting your deadline** and you'll be able to shape the end-result too.
- I have an **innovative proposal** and â€“ I'll help _as-and-when things change_ because that's what maintainence is really about.

### A reliable & accountable supplier

In a perfect world, your **bandwidth** should be focusing making business decisions about your charity â€“Â rather than thinking about technology risk!

Technically, the work I will deliver is informed by prior design and development already working for [CWB, UK](https://cwb.org.uk/), National Geographic and similar organisations. In general they prioritse a responsible tech-partner over cost â€“ have a look at one of my recent [reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/users/637cf2765bc60600112957fc) for example.

#### How do we know you really will be accountable?

**An RFP is just a guide**: how do we both know we've covered everything? Don't worry. When you work with me it's ok to change your mind and develop your idea!

> I can make things fit your needs because I have designed my own platform: _flexibility_ is where I shine.

### Meeting your deadline

ðŸš€ **[CWB.US.ORG](https://www.cwb.us.org/) is ready when you are!**

I aim to use **[CWB.US.ORG](https://www.cwb.us.org/)** as a staging site for development, then perform a migration whenever you and your team are totally happy.

Behind the scenes [CWB.US.ORG](https://www.cwb.us.org/) is ready for your content editor to login! Here is an overview of _some_ of the technologies installed already:

#### Maintainence Flexibility

There is no reason to stick to rigid blueprint as I am happy to help you grow, whatever your demands might be. These incremental tweaks are included in your maintainence budget.

#### Implementation

I propose delivering the following:

- a CMS + UAT (User Acceptance Testing). I aim to give you flexibility and have already done some research to get you up and running.
- building
- building

##### CMS + UAT (User Acceptance Testing)

Over the past two weeks I have prepared a next-gen CMS with the following criteria: `Easy to manage`, `not dependent on a 3rd party developer` and enables you to `make changes to the menu bar, including menu options, drop down options, and logo`, etc.

This choice <!-- https://hygraph.com/docs/guides/content/creating-content --> is focused on versatility and the company aims to bring the benefits of Wordpress' ease-of-use with the security and speed of.

###### What is UAT (User Acceptance Testing), and why do I need it?

I have already done some research to get you up and running, but you must be sure the new platform suits your your needs.

On paying your deposit, you and your team can test this new platform â€“ and, as always:

> &hellip;if you eventually think this decision isn't right for you, then I can make different suggestions that meet competing wants and needs.

While it's _not_ encouraged after a few months: you can decide to swap components (like your choice of CMS). This is because I am developing my own, modular platform. This gives us more flex than pre-made templates.




#### Use `Websites we love!` as inspiration

In your original RFP, you mentioned the following: [Clowns Without Borders UK](https://cwb.org.uk/) Owl & Panther, and Charity Water. I'd like to take these on-board directly:

- Charity Water uses "The Colors of Dirty Water" as a story-telling device. **I have been inspired to make a prototype solution from this idea**. You can see this immediately on paying your deposit.
- [Clowns Without Borders UK](https://cwb.org.uk/), my approach builds on what already works in this site. I also have an exciting new colour-scheme ready for you.
