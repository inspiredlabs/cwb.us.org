## Risk Assessment

Firstly, I have studied your `Budget Review` and want to help you get the best value for money:

- To help you **meet your deadline**, I have demos to speed up your decision making, such as a custom CMS.
- I have a **flexible proposal**. In absence of all the information about your `Target Audience` and future strategy, I aim to build something that is tailored to your needs.
- The maintainence budget will allow for scope for on-going changes and improvements.
- Accountablity. People regard me as a helpful to work with, see: [TrustPilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/users/637cf2765bc60600112957fc) and
[LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/urbanaut#recommendations).

### Meeting the Deadline

üöÄ **[CWB.US.ORG](https://www.cwb.us.org/) is ready when you are!**

I aim to use **[CWB.US.ORG](https://www.cwb.us.org/)** as a staging site for development, then perform the migration when you are totally happy.

Behind the scenes [CWB.US.ORG](https://www.cwb.us.org/) is ready. Here is an overview of _some_ of the technologies installed already:

![Behind the scenes CWB.US.ORG is ready for your content editor to login!](https://www.cwb.us.org/images/cwb.us.org.webp "Behind the scenes CWB.US.ORG is already for you to login!")

### Maintainence Process

There is no reason to stick to a rigid blueprint as I am happy to help you grow, whatever your demands might be. Incremental improvements are included in your maintainence budget. And, for peace of mind:

> maintainence will only happen _after_ migration.

### The Double Diamond Process

> The **Double Diamond** is a strategy to bind everything together and also visualise where we are in whole the process&hellip;

This holistic approach helps us iterate where appropriate, and build on known outcomes and information.

![The Double Diamond is a strategy to bind everything together and also visualise where we are in whole the process](https://www.cwb.us.org/color/double-diamond.webp "The Double Diamond helps us, like a map to visualise where we are in the whole process")

## Deliverables:

### Day One Demos:

- `Storytelling` meets `UX` video component demo.
- `Automated SEO Suggestions` demo.
- Design and `Color Suggestions` demo.
- See `True Colors` blog idea/demo.
- CMS demo.

### Discovery Phase

- Who are the `Target Audience`? Answer questions and establish their needs.
- To shape the design and `IA`, we need `priority content`. This should be 12 posts + [the Ukraine post](https://clownswithoutborders.org/ukrainian-refugees-co-create-fun-and-entertainment-with-clowns-in-romania/), tailored for the `Target Audience`.
- Apply `Information Architecture` for consistency.
- Understand the strategy in detail.


### Define and Development Phases

- Understand our `Target Audience` and the resulting design implications.
- Add requirements to help with CMS training and `UAT` as appropriate.
- Iterate `IA`, Messaging and `CTA` to suit the `Target Audience`:
  - Consider one `slogan` to apply everywhere.
- Review, test and iterate content and ensure it meets the strategy.
- Clarify `Migration`.


### Delivery Phase

- Sign-Off the Design.
- `Migrate`.
- September: first Annual Maintenance period begins.

## Payment

- Day One: **First payment (50% of total budget)**
- Sign-Off the Design: **Second payment (50% of total budget)**
- September: **Annual Maintenance payment (100% of Maintenance budget)**

## Implementation of the Discovery Phase

### CMS Approval

I propose a custom CMS, that is tailored to your workflow:

- CMS requirements:
  - **I see `Easy to manage` is important to you.** In my experience _easy_ often competes with _versatile_. This can be a hard problem to solve for everyone. However, we can collect these requirements and turn them into actionable criteria to assess the most appropriate solution.
  - I can help identify a CMS which is `Easy to manage`, `not dependent on a 3rd party developer` and versatile enough for you to `make changes to the menu bar, including menu options, drop down options, and logo`.
  - The CMS should bring ease-of-use features, like `Wordpress`, and next-gen speed and security.
- Testing and `UAT`:
  - To be certain this new platform suits your needs ‚Äì¬†you should try it before you live with it! One way to do this properly is through `User Acceptance Testing` or `UAT`. This assessment process is aimed at getting you only what you need. This works using training and tailoring the CMS to your criteria.
  - `UAT` keeps you in control, helping you strike a balance of _technical intervention_, and where you are happy work _autonomously_.

### Design Inspiration

We can use `Websites we love!` as inspiration.

| Website: | Noteworthy because: | How we could develop this&hellip; |
| - | -- | --- |
| Charity&nbsp;Water | `Storytelling`: "The Colors of Dirty Water" | Blog idea, called **_True Colors_**. I have a demo for you.<!-- entertain w. clever interpretations for post headlines& social media excerpts? https://www.myenglishteacher.eu/blog/colour-idioms-list-and-their-meanings/ --> |
| [CWB,&nbsp;UK](https://cwb.org.uk/) | Crisp, impactful `UI` with an emphasis on fundraising | See `Storytelling` meets `UX` video component demo. Align strategy and design goals. |
| Owl & Panther | Immediate clarity of purpose. Compelling, yet minimal publishing | Helps shape `Messaging and CTA`: strike a chord while exercising restraint. <br>Less is more. |
| [Plan C](https://www.weareplanc.org/modules/) | A strong voice. A sophisticated discourse on degrowth. Imprefect, bold graphics. | Leverage the power of `Storytelling`. <br>Match content and graphics. |

### Information Architecture

What is `Information Architecture`?

> `Information Architecture`, or `IA`: is a way of adding clarity, findability and meaning to disparate, related ideas and is vital for cohesive engagement.

By reimagining the `IA`, we can systematically structure our ideas to consistently engage our `Target Audience`. This includes:

- Website stucture:
  - we need `priority content` to complete this step.
  - apply consistent, clear and concise language.
  - Apply a logical layout to satisfy mixed ability users.
- Messaging and `CTA`.
- Findability and Visual Treatment.

<!--
Website stucture and content:
```
- homepage:
	- impact of our work
  - main `CTA`
  - Why Laughter Matters
  - video (See: `Storytelling` meets `UX` demo)
  - Our Mission
- Partner With Us
- About Us
	- Our Story
	- How we work
	- Annual Reports
- Contact Us
- Blog:
	- `Storytelling` template in use
	- 12 posts (migrated)
	- appropriate video embed (See: `Storytelling` meets `UX` demo).
```
-->

#### Messaging and `CTA`

In modern life there is a signal-to-noise problem! That's why we tailor delivery to our `Target Audience`.

> üóùÔ∏è Key question: From your current Messaging and `CTA`, how do we know what is working well and what needs updating?

- Give Laughter (aka. `Donate`).
- [Current homepage](https://clownswithoutborders.org/donate-clowns-without-borders/): We Bring Laughter Where It's Needed Most
- [Current homepage](https://clownswithoutborders.org/donate-clowns-without-borders/): _Our Mission: **Clowns Without Borders** offers joy and laughter to relieve the suffering of all persons, especially children, who live in areas of crisis including refugee camps, conflict zones and territories in situations of emergency. Vision&hellip;_ <!-- prompt: CWB's mission laughter and joy to build resilience of children living in areas of crisis including refugee camps, conflict zones and territories in situations of emergency.
Shrink that to as few words as possible. -->
- [Buffer](https://clownswithoutborders.start.page/): _Resilience through laughter_
- [Kindful](https://clownswithoutborders.kindful.com/): _Give Laughter_
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CWBUSA): _CWB offers laughter to bring relief to children living in crisis areas. We also seek to raise our society‚Äôs awareness of affected populations._
- [Current website donate page](https://clownswithoutborders.org/donate-clowns-without-borders/): _You can make a difference to displaced children. Everyone deserves to laugh._
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/clownswithoutborders.usa/): _Sharing resilience through laughter to bring relief to children living in crisis areas._
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/clownswithoutborders/): _Laughing Matters - where all other resources are scarce, laughter can and should be abundant._
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@clownswithoutbordersusa): No about page.

> üóùÔ∏è Key question: Before each `CTA`, should we replace these with a cohesive, consistent `slogan`?

<!--
2023 `slogan`, how to use `Impact Language`:

> Laughter to bring relief to children living in crisis zones

> Resilience through laughter, where it's needed most

> Give laughter, where it's needed most

2023 Mission update:

> Our Mission: Bring resilience to children in crisis

#### Different `CTA` for different people

People in your network are already aligned with your values, but they need different `CTA`. A good `Call To Action`, should remove barriers and help you and your `Target Audience` meet each other's goals:

- people on social media:
  - **amplify your reviews**
  - share your stories.
  - subscribe to your newsletter.
- take more complex steps such as:
  - `Partner`&hellip;
  - begin `Grant Funding`, etc&hellip;
- donate:
  - frequently.
  - once.

#### Findability and Visual Treatment

Effective `Information Architecture` means applying this structure visually.

Established brands have iconic symbols, this improved recognition and helps brands stand out. Here is a demo of how this might work with your current content.

Note how much contrast there is after tweaking the video thumbnails:

![Be bold: use contrast](https://www.cwb.us.org/color/social-media.webp "Be bold: use contrast")

![Resopnsive Logo](https://www.cwb.us.org/color/responsive-logo.gif "Resopnsive Logo")
-->

Ideas for applying `Information Architecture` visually include:

- Help people easily recognise the Clowns Without Borders brand.
- Use visual contrast to:
  - help decision makers during the grant application process.
  - highlight impact and involvement in project work.
  - highlight parts of human interest stories.
- Adapt layouts to fit `Target Audience` needs.

## Define and Development Phases

### Definiton Phase

Criteria from the [Draft Scope of Work](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yllA93psWqnSYZyzTD-fRXlxOVxbvOsbWozY6jQfV1o), acknowledges that there are different `Target Audience` segments.

These have different `UX` outcomes:

- `Grant Funders` looking for evidence of responsibility and impact:
  - we should provide clutter-free information for them to make appropriate decisions while they review our grant application.
  - share `Partner Visability` with our `Partners` and `Collaborators`.
  - represent past work appropriately, use only detail that is important to our `Target Audience`.
- **within 60s** `Partner/Collaborators`, such as `ACNUR` or `Terres Des Hommes` need assurance CWB are a trusted, professional partner with a good track record.
  - &hellip;use `Partner Visability` to spotlight our partner's work.
- In **30s** `visitors from organic search & social media` should be able to:
  - understand what we do.
  - make frequent or one-time donations.
  - take appropriate action on social media.
- Define what actions `Supporters` from the CRM should be doing.

## Delivery Phase

### Mobile First ü•á

The layout should meet different goals for our `Target Audience`. We should:

- Prioritise different `Target Audience` needs.
- Deliver a strong `Storytelling` experience.
- Provide a resource conscious `UX`.

#### Prioritise different `Target Audience` needs

Mobile First is important because when websites are served fast it helps them rank well on search engines. `Grant Funders` and `Partners` might prefer laptop or desktops, so we need to layout the information appropriately.

> üóùÔ∏è Key question: can existing website [analytics](https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-38080782-1) help us define which  `Devices` our `Target Audience` use?

#### Provide a resource conscious `UX`

`Devices` refers to a mix of computers from `Apple`, `Android`, `Windows touchscreen` and `Ubuntu`. By providing a resource conscious `UX` we can measure how fast our website performs (using _Google's Lighthouse test_). For example: this is how CWB,&nbsp;UK scores:

![how CWB,&nbsp;UK scores](https://www.cwb.us.org/color/nobody-does-it-better.webp "Scott scores 100% on Google's Lighthouse test")
