# Clowns Without Borders US

## SCOPE OF WORK

### Naomi's risk assesment requirements

Firstly, I have studied your `Budget Review` and want to help you get the best value for money, while being flexible and trustworthy:

- I am a reliable & accountable supplier.
- I can guarantee **meeting your deadline** and you'll be able to shape the end-result too.
- I have an **innovative proposal** and â€“ can help _as-and-when things change_ because that's the inherent advantage of a maintainence budget.

### A reliable & accountable supplier

In a perfect world, your focus should be making business decisions about your charity â€“Â rather than thinking about tech. Here, I aim to derisk technology for you and offer clarification whenever you need it.

#### How do we know you be able to deliver?

My work is informed by prior design and development for other businesses, including [CWB, UK](https://cwb.org.uk/), National Geographic and other communication-concious  organisations. In general, they prioritse a responsible tech-partner over cost.

Just have a look at one of my recent [reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/users/637cf2765bc60600112957fc).

There is no rigid blueprint, **this RFP is just a guide**: _when do we know we've covered everything?_ Don't worry. When you work with me it's ok to change your mind and develop your idea â€“ it's part of the process!

> I can make things fit your needs because I have designed my own platform: _flexibility_ is where I shine.

### Meeting your deadline

ðŸš€ **[CWB.US.ORG](https://www.cwb.us.org/) is ready when you are!**

I aim to use **[CWB.US.ORG](https://www.cwb.us.org/)** as a staging site for development, then perform a migration whenever you and your team are totally happy.

Behind the scenes [CWB.US.ORG](https://www.cwb.us.org/) is already for you to login! Here is an overview of _some_ of the technologies installed already:

![Behind the scenes CWB.US.ORG is ready for your content editor to login!](https://www.cwb.us.org/images/cwb.us.org.webp "Behind the scenes CWB.US.ORG is already for you to login!")

### An innovative proposal

- Maintainence Flexibility
- Implementation:
    - CMS + UAT (User Acceptance Testing).
    - Use `Websites we love!` as inspiration
    - Playful + Mobile First ðŸ¥‡

#### Maintainence Flexibility

There is no reason to stick to a rigid blueprint as I am happy to help you grow, whatever your demands might be. These incremental tweaks are included in your maintainence budget. And, for peace of mind:

> Maintainence will only happen _after_ migration.

#### Implementation

In a nutshell, I propose delivering the following:

- a CMS + UAT (User Acceptance Testing). I have already done some research to get you up and running that gives you something `Easy to manage` yet, with the flexibility you are looking for.
- Use `Websites we love!` as inspiration: You've told me what works for you and I have clear ideas how to make this work on your site!
- Playful + Mobile First ðŸ¥‡

##### CMS + UAT (User Acceptance Testing)

Over the past two weeks, I have prepared a CMS that is: `Easy to manage`, `not dependent on a 3rd party developer` and versatile enough for you to `make changes to the menu bar, including menu options, drop down options, and logo`.

This choice is of CMS aims to bring ease-of-use (like `Wordpress`), with the security and speed of next-gen webapps<!-- (if you're technically minded you can think of these as `transitional apps` running on the `JAMstack`) -->.

###### I see `Easy to manage` is important to you

In my experience _easy_ often competes with _versatile_. This can be a hard problem to solve for everyone.

However, there are new and emerging ways to make life easier for content producers and editors. For example, AI can produce `Automated SEO Suggestions`. This may sound complicated, but in reality, I have used AI since 2016 and have a working demo using CWB content for you can see.


###### What is UAT (User Acceptance Testing), and why do we need it?

To be sure any platform suits your your needs I will help with training you how to use your new CMS as part of `User Acceptance Testing`. We'll go through it together until you're happy<!--the solution is viable-->.

I have done some research to get you up and running and on paying your deposit, you can test this platform â€“ and, as always:

> &hellip;if you eventually think this decision isn't right for you, then I can make different suggestions to help meet competing needs-and-wants.

While it's _not_ encouraged after a few months, you can always decide to swap components (like a CMS). This is because I am developing my own flexible platform.

#### Use `Websites we love!` as inspiration

In the original `RFP`, you mentioned the following: [Clowns Without Borders UK](https://cwb.org.uk/), and Charity Water. Following these sites, I propose the following:

- Charity Water uses "The Colors of Dirty Water" as a story-telling device. **I have been inspired to make a demo called: _True Color Blog_**. You can see this whenever you're ready.
- [Clowns Without Borders UK](https://cwb.org.uk/), my approach builds on what already works well, with an different, yet exciting colour-scheme and ideas on how we can use video.
- What struck a chord for me, when I looked at `Owl & Panther` was the clarity. They don't publish much. What they have however, as a result of restraint is direct and compelling.
- `Plan C` have a very strong voice. This means we should concentrate on the `Target Audience` expectations through writing.

#### Mobile First ðŸ¥‡

This section is about layout and will also cover how we go about `Creating a Win-Win scenario`.

##### Playful

Bold, graphic communication is my passion. So, I have prepared some **Color Suggestions** <!-- [Color Suggestions](https://www.cwb.us.org/color) --> to spark your imagination. We should make something that looks the part â€“Â as well as works properly too!

Everyone knows Dropbox, Stripe and Mailchimp have serious, yet playful design&hellip; Apple are typography leaders. Google appear harmless with colourful letters, but let's take our inspiration much further:

- [Who gives a crap?](https://uk.whogivesacrap.org/) â€“Â know how to use illustration!
- [Cotopaxi](https://www.cotopaxi.com/collections/all-packs)'s _Gear for Good_ slogan suits thier lively color-scheme.
- [NYTimes](https://www.wappalyzer.com/technologies/ui-frameworks/sveltekit/) blends excellent typography and layouts with playful graphics&hellip; and, they are built using the same tools I use.

##### Mobile First

Today, the web is predominantly mobile. If we develop our ideas so they work well on small screens and phones, it's easy to make them work well on larger displays (on the desktop).

- I aim to deliver a similar experience as in CWB, UK with a thoughtful implementation of video â€“ without compromising the `UX (User Experience)`. EG:
    - using video where we know there's likely to be more resources such as bandwidth.
    - skillfully draw viewer attention away from load times. <!-- [humaan](https://www.humaan.com/) -->
- device choice: I will be using a mix of mobile and desktop from `Apple`, `Android`, `Windows touchscreen` and `Ubuntu`.
- Can you steer our device choice? When you know the `make & model` your fundraising strategy focuses on, I can apply a specific design treatment there.

###### Creating a Win-Win scenario

We should create a Win-Win scenario for our `Target Audience` by shaping different people's `UX` for positive outcomes:

| `Target Audience` | `UX` outcome |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Kindful / Constant Contact | Feel involved |
| Grant Funder | grasps our credentials `within 60s` |
| Grant Funder | &hellip;and then take the next step |
| Potential Partner | grasps our credentials `within 60s` |
| Potential Partner | &hellip;and then collaborate |
| Search Visitors | understand what we do `within 30s` |
| etc&hellip; | &nbsp; |
