# Clowns Without Borders US

## SCOPE OF WORK

### Naomi's risk assesment requirements

Firstly, I have studied your `Budget Review` and want to help you get the best value for money, while being flexible and trustworthy:

- I am a reliable & accountable supplier.
- I can guarantee **meeting your deadline** and you'll be able to shape the end-result too.
- I have an **innovative proposal** and â€“ can help _as-and-when things change_ because that's the inherent advantage of a maintainence budget.

### A reliable & accountable supplier

In a perfect world, your focus should be making business decisions about your charity â€“Â rather than thinking about tech. Here, I aim to derisk technology for you and offer clarification whenever you need it.

#### How do we know you'll be able to deliver?

My work is informed by prior design and development for other businesses, including [Clowns Without Borders, UK (**CWB, UK**)](https://cwb.org.uk/), National Geographic and other communication-concious  organisations. In general, they prioritse a responsible tech-partner over cost.

Just have a look at one of my recent [reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/users/637cf2765bc60600112957fc).

There is no rigid blueprint, **this RFP is just a guide**: _when do we know we've covered everything?_ Don't worry. When you work with me it's ok to change your mind and develop your idea â€“ it's part of the process!

> I can make things fit your needs because I have designed my own platform: _flexibility_ is where I shine.

### Meeting your deadline

ðŸš€ **[CWB.US.ORG](https://www.cwb.us.org/) is ready when you are!**

I aim to use **[CWB.US.ORG](https://www.cwb.us.org/)** as a staging site for development, then perform a migration whenever you and your team are totally happy.

Behind the scenes [CWB.US.ORG](https://www.cwb.us.org/) is already for you to login! Here is an overview of _some_ of the technologies installed already:

  - I aim to sign-off in advance of September
  - Migrate  according to the `Migration Definition`
- September:

#### Maintainence Flexibility

There is no reason to stick to a rigid blueprint as I am happy to help you grow, whatever your demands might be. These incremental tweaks are included in your maintainence budget. And, for peace of mind:

> Maintainence will only happen _after_ migration.

#### Implementation

In a nutshell, I propose delivering the following:

- a CMS + `UAT (User Acceptance Testing)`. I have already done some research to get you up and running that gives you something `Easy to manage` yet, with the flexibility you are looking for.
- Use `Websites we love!` as inspiration: You've told me what works for you â€“ and I have clear ideas how to make this work!
- Mobile First ðŸ¥‡ â€“Â this section will cover graphic communication, layout and devices.
- Strategically design a Win-Win scenario for our `Target Audience`. Here I'll discuss the design and development stage of the project and what questions we'll need to answer to get the best result.

##### CMS + `UAT (User Acceptance Testing)`

Over the past two weeks, I have prepared a CMS that is: `Easy to manage`, `not dependent on a 3rd party developer` and versatile enough for you to `make changes to the menu bar, including menu options, drop down options, and logo`.

This choice is of CMS aims to bring ease-of-use (like `Wordpress`), with the security and speed of next-gen webapps<!-- (if you're technically minded you can think of these as `transitional apps` running on the `JAMstack`) -->.

###### I see `Easy to manage` is important to you

In my experience _easy_ often competes with _versatile_. This can be a hard problem to solve for everyone.

However, there are new and emerging ways to make life easier for content producers and editors. For example, AI can produce `Automated SEO Suggestions`. This may sound complicated, but in reality, I have been using AI since 2016 and have a proof-of-concept demo using content from [CWB,&nbsp;UK](https://cwb.org.uk/).

###### What is `UAT (User Acceptance Testing)`, and why do we need it?

To be certain the new platform suits your needs â€“Â you should try it, before you live with it! `UAT` is the process of trying something out, feedback and training (as required).

Going through things like this helps us strike a balance between: where you need _my professional intervention_ and where you are happy doing things _autonomously_.

I have done some research to get you up and running and on paying your deposit, you can test this platform â€“ and, as always:

> &hellip;if you eventually think this decision isn't right for you, then I can make different suggestions to help meet competing needs-and-wants.

While it's _not_ encouraged after a few months, you can always decide to swap components (like a CMS). This is because I am developing my own flexible platform.

#### Use `Websites we love!` as inspiration

| Website: | Noteworthy because: | How we could develop this&hellip; |
| - | -- | --- |
| Charity&nbsp;Water | `Storytelling`: "The Colors of Dirty Water" | A  blog called **_True Colors_**. You can see this demo when you're ready |
| [CWB,&nbsp;UK](https://cwb.org.uk/) | Crisp, impactful `UI` with an emphasis on fundraising | Add video and strategically align business goals with design ambitions |
| Owl & Panther | Immediate clarity of purpose. Compelling, yet minimal publishing | Strike a chord while exercising restraint. <br>Less is more. |
| [Plan C](https://www.weareplanc.org/modules/) | A strong voice. A sophisticated discourse on degrowth. Imprefect, bold graphics. | Leverage the power of `Storytelling`. <br>Match content and graphics. |

#### Mobile First ðŸ¥‡

The layout should meet the goals of our `Target Audience`. This means:

- Provide a resource concious `UX`.
- Deliver a strong `Storytelling` experience to meet business goals.
- Prioritise who our `Target Audience` are, what we know about them and steer the graphic communication.
