# Clowns Without Borders US

## SCOPE OF WORK

### Naomi's risk assesment requirements

Firstly, I have studied your `Budget Review` and want to help you get the best value for money, while being flexible and trustworthy:

- I am a reliable & accountable supplier.
- I can guarantee **meeting your deadline** and you'll be able to shape the end-result too.
- I have an **innovative proposal** and â€“ can help _as-and-when things change_ because that's the inherent advantage of a maintainence budget.

### A reliable & accountable supplier

In a perfect world, your **bandwidth** should be focused on making business decisions about your charity â€“Â rather than thinking about technology. Here, I aim to derisk tech for you and you can always ask for clarification whenever you need it.

#### How do we know you be able to deliver?

Technically, my work is informed by prior design and development for other businesses, including [CWB, UK](https://cwb.org.uk/), National Geographic and other communication-concious  organisations. In general, they prioritse a responsible tech-partner over cost.

Just have a look at one of my recent [reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/users/637cf2765bc60600112957fc).

There is no rigid blueprint, **this RFP is just a guide**: when do we know we've covered everything? Don't worry. When you work with me it's ok to change your mind or develop your idea â€“ it's part of the process!

> I can make things fit your needs because I have designed my own platform: _flexibility_ is where I shine.

### Meeting your deadline

ðŸš€ **[CWB.US.ORG](https://www.cwb.us.org/) is ready when you are!**

I aim to use **[CWB.US.ORG](https://www.cwb.us.org/)** as a staging site for development, then perform a migration whenever you and your team are totally happy.

Behind the scenes [CWB.US.ORG](https://www.cwb.us.org/) is already for you to login! Here is an overview of _some_ of the technologies installed already:

### An innovative proposal

- Maintainence Flexibility
- Implementation:
    - CMS + UAT (User Acceptance Testing).
    - Use `Websites we love!` as inspiration
    - Playful + Mobile First ðŸ¥‡

#### Maintainence Flexibility

There is no reason to stick to a rigid blueprint as I am happy to help you grow, whatever your demands might be. These incremental tweaks are included in your maintainence budget.

#### Implementation

In a nutshell, I propose delivering the following:

- a CMS + UAT (User Acceptance Testing). I have already done some research to get you up and running that gives you the flexibility you are looking for.
- Use `Websites we love!` as inspiration: You've told me what works for you, so, let's see if I can work it into your site!
- Mobile First ðŸ¥‡

##### CMS + UAT (User Acceptance Testing)

Over the past two weeks I have prepared a next-gen CMS with the following criteria: `Easy to manage`, `not dependent on a 3rd party developer` and enables you to `make changes to the menu bar, including menu options, drop down options, and logo`, etc.

This choice <!-- https://hygraph.com/docs/guides/content/creating-content --> is focused on versatility and the CMS aims to bring the benefits of ease-of-use (similar to `Wordpress`), with the security and speed of next-gen webapps<!-- (if you're technically minded you can think of these as `transitional apps` running on the `JAMstack`) -->.

###### I can see `Easy to manage` is important to you

This is actually a very hard problem, in my experience _easy_ always competes with _versatile_.

However, there are new and emerging ways to make life easier for content producers and editors. For example SEO suggestions using AI. Automation often sounds complicated, but in reality, I already have a working demo for you.

###### What is UAT (User Acceptance Testing), and why do we need it?

I have done some research to get you up and running, but you must be sure that the new platform suits your your needs. That's what  `User Acceptance Testing` means.

On paying your deposit, you and your team can test this new platform â€“ and, as always:

> &hellip;if you eventually think this decision isn't right for you, then I can make different suggestions to help meet competing needs-and-wants.

While it's _not_ encouraged after a few months, you can always decide to swap components (like your CMS). This is because I am developing my own modular platform. This gives us flexabilty way beyond pre-made templates!

#### Use `Websites we love!` as inspiration

In the original `RFP`, you mentioned the following: [Clowns Without Borders UK](https://cwb.org.uk/) Owl & Panther, and Charity Water.

What struck a chord regarding `Owl & Panther`? If you give me more  I can take these on-board directly:

- Charity Water uses "The Colors of Dirty Water" as a story-telling device. **I have been inspired to make a prototype solution from this idea**. You can see this immediately on paying your deposit.
- [Clowns Without Borders UK](https://cwb.org.uk/), my approach builds on what already works well, with an different, yet exciting colour-scheme and ideas on how we can use video.
- Bold, graphic communication. I was a Graphic Designer before becoming involved in development, so hopefully we can make something that looks the part too!

#### Playful + Mobile First ðŸ¥‡

Today, the web is predominantly mobile. If we develop our ideas so they work well on small screens and phones, it's easy to make them work well on larger displays (like Laptops and Desktops).

- I aim to deliver a similar experience as in CWB.ORG.UK. For your site I can perform a thoughtful implementation of video â€“ one that won't compromise the UX (User Experience). One idea would be using video where there's more resources like bandwidth and device speed.
- device choice (you can help me with devices you know you'll need), and I'll do manuall hands on testing here as I write the layout code.
- Playful.
