## Risk Assessment

Firstly, I have studied your `Budget Review` and want to help you get the best value for money:

- To help you **meet your deadline**, I have demos to speed up your decision making, such as a custom CMS.
- I have a **flexible proposal**. In absence of all the information about your `Target Audience` and future strategy, I aim to build something that is tailored to your needs.
- The maintainence budget will allow for scope for on-going changes and improvements.
- Accountablity. People regard me as a helpful to work with, see: [TrustPilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/users/637cf2765bc60600112957fc) and
[LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/urbanaut#recommendations).

## Meeting the Deadline

üöÄ **[CWB.US.ORG](https://www.cwb.us.org/) is ready when you are!**

I aim to use **[CWB.US.ORG](https://www.cwb.us.org/)** as a staging site for development, then perform the migration when you are totally happy.

Behind the scenes [CWB.US.ORG](https://www.cwb.us.org/) is ready. Here is an overview of _some_ of the technologies installed already:

![Behind the scenes CWB.US.ORG is ready for your content editor to login!](https://www.cwb.us.org/images/cwb.us.org.webp "Behind the scenes CWB.US.ORG is already for you to login!")

### Maintainence Process

There is no reason to stick to a rigid blueprint as I am happy to help you grow, whatever your demands might be. These incremental tweaks are included in your maintainence budget. And, for peace of mind:

> maintainence will only happen _after_ migration.

## Deliverables:

### Day One Demos:

- `Storytelling` meets `UX` video component demo.
- `Automated SEO Suggestions` demo.
- Design and `Color Suggestions` demo.
- See `True Colors` blog idea/demo.
- CMS demo.

### Discovery Phase

- Answer questions and establish the `Target Audience`, and their needs.
- To shape the design and `IA`, we need `priority content`. This should be 12 posts + [the Ukraine post](https://clownswithoutborders.org/ukrainian-refugees-co-create-fun-and-entertainment-with-clowns-in-romania/), tailored for the `Target Audience`.
- Apply `Information Architecture` for consistency.
- Understand the strategy in detail.

### Define and Development Phases

- Add requirements to help with CMS training and `UAT` as appropriate.
- Iterate `IA`, Messaging and `CTA` to suit the `Target Audience`.
- Review the content and ensure it meets the strategy.
- Test and iterate. Give feedback and refine strategy.
- Clarify `Migration`.

### Delivery Phase

- Sign-Off the Design.
- `Migrate`.
- September: first Annual Maintenance period begins.

## Payment

- Day One: **First payment (50% of total budget)**
- Sign-Off the Design: **Second payment (50% of total budget)**
- September: **Annual Maintenance payment (100% of Maintenance budget)**

## Implementation of the Discovery Phase

### The Double Diamond Process

> The **Double Diamond** is a map that helps us visualise where we are in the process&hellip;

This holistic approach helps us iterate where appropriate, and build on the right outcome for the design.

![The Double Diamond is a map that helps us visualise where we are in the process](https://www.cwb.us.org/color/double-diamond.webp "The Double Diamond helps us, like a map to visualise where we are in the whole process")

### CMS Approval

I propose a custom CMS, that is tailored to your workflow:

- CMS requirements:
  - I aim to deliver something `Easy to manage`, `not dependent on a 3rd party developer` and versatile enough for you to `make changes to the menu bar, including menu options, drop down options, and logo`.
  - **I see `Easy to manage` is important to you.** In my experience _easy_ often competes with _versatile_. This can be a hard problem to solve for everyone. However, there are ways of taking onboard specific requirements.
  - A CMS should bring ease-of-use features, like `Wordpress`, and next-gen speed and security.
- Testing and `UAT`:
  - To be certain this new platform suits your needs ‚Äì¬†you should try it before you live with it! `User Acceptance Testing` / `UAT` is the process training and feedback.
  - You can decide where to strike the balance of _design intervention_ and where you are happy to write content _autonomously_. This means I can help meet seeming competing needs-and-wants via technical improvements.

### Design Inspiration

We can use `Websites we love!` as inspiration.

| Website: | Noteworthy because: | How we could develop this&hellip; |
| - | -- | --- |
| Charity&nbsp;Water | `Storytelling`: "The Colors of Dirty Water" | Blog idea, called **_True Colors_**. A demo is ready <!-- entertain w. clever interpretations for post headlines& social media excerpts? https://www.myenglishteacher.eu/blog/colour-idioms-list-and-their-meanings/ --> |
| [CWB,&nbsp;UK](https://cwb.org.uk/) | Crisp, impactful `UI` with an emphasis on fundraising | See `Storytelling` meets `UX` video component demo. Align strategy and design goals. |
| Owl & Panther | Immediate clarity of purpose. Compelling, yet minimal publishing | Strike a chord while exercising restraint. <br>Less is more. |
| [Plan C](https://www.weareplanc.org/modules/) | A strong voice. A sophisticated discourse on degrowth. Imprefect, bold graphics. | Leverage the power of `Storytelling`. <br>Match content and graphics. |

### Information Architecture

What is `Information Architecture`?

> `Information Architecture`, or `IA`: is a way of adding clarity, findability and meaning to disparate, related ideas and is vital for cohesive engagement.

By reimagining the `IA`, we can systematically structure our ideas to consistently engage our `Target Audience`. This includes:

- Website stucture and content (`priority content` is required to complete this step).
- Messaging and `CTA`.
- Visual Treatment.

<!--
Website stucture and content:
```
- homepage:
	- impact of our work
  - main `CTA`
  - Why Laughter Matters
  - video (See: `Storytelling` meets `UX` demo)
  - Our Mission
- Partner With Us
- About Us
	- Our Story
	- How we work
	- Annual Reports
- Contact Us
- Blog:
	- `Storytelling` template in use
	- 12 posts (migrated)
	- appropriate video embed (See: `Storytelling` meets `UX` demo).
```
-->

#### Messaging and `CTA`

In modern life there is a signal-to-noise problem! That's why we tailor delivery to our `Target Audience`.

> üóùÔ∏è Key question: From your Current `CTA` Messaging, how do we know what is working well and what needs updating?

- Give Laughter (aka. `Donate`).
- [Current homepage](https://clownswithoutborders.org/donate-clowns-without-borders/): We Bring Laughter Where It's Needed Most
- [Current homepage](https://clownswithoutborders.org/donate-clowns-without-borders/): _Our Mission: **Clowns Without Borders** offers joy and laughter to relieve the suffering of all persons, especially children, who live in areas of crisis including refugee camps, conflict zones and territories in situations of emergency. Vision&hellip;_ <!-- prompt: CWB's mission laughter and joy to build resilience of children living in areas of crisis including refugee camps, conflict zones and territories in situations of emergency.
Shrink that to as few words as possible. -->
- [Buffer](https://clownswithoutborders.start.page/): _Resilience through laughter_
- [Kindful](https://clownswithoutborders.kindful.com/): _Give Laughter_
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CWBUSA): _CWB offers laughter to bring relief to children living in crisis areas. We also seek to raise our society‚Äôs awareness of affected populations._
- [Current website donate page](https://clownswithoutborders.org/donate-clowns-without-borders/): _You can make a difference to displaced children. Everyone deserves to laugh._
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/clownswithoutborders.usa/): _Sharing resilience through laughter to bring relief to children living in crisis areas._
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/clownswithoutborders/): _Laughing Matters - where all other resources are scarce, laughter can and should be abundant._
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@clownswithoutbordersusa): No about page.

#### Structured `CTA`

A good `Call To Action`, should remove barriers and help people become aligned with your values so you can meet each other's goals.

Structured `CTA`:

- donate.
- subscribe or share across social media.
- take more complex steps such as `Partner` or begin `Grant Funding`.
- **amplify your excellent reviews**.
- Apply messaging to fit `Target Audience` needs.
