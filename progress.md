- `visitors from search`:
  - use qualified `keyword research` (see [tools](https://seoscout.com/suggest)). Go beyond SEO and deliver what they're actually asking ():
    - - use SEO keyword check:
    - why do people give money to charity?

How do we find our `Target Audience`?

It should be safe to say that at this stage, `visitors from organic search & social media` have been fine for `sustainment`. But, even with an awesome SEO content drive <!-- tonnes of luck ‚Äì¬†that might only be able to raise the volume slightly --> that might not get the desired growth you're looking for.

> Athletes are people that can make a huge difference. They are the `Grant Funders` and the `Movers & Shakers` in your sector. Your current supporters represent the other end of the spectrum.

#### Movers & Shakers

- In an ideal outcome: target just the people who can make life better:
  - The goal is to target _2 or 3 people in the whole world_.
  - they might be your most reliable `Grant Funders`, or perhaps new `Sponsors` with specific investment goals that you already fulfil.
- Thinking Big: [Michael Jordan](https://wish.org/michael-jordan-gift) celebrates his 60th in style!
  - By making a **$10m** donation to _Make-A-Wish_ it sends `Social Proof` of their impact. They deliver on their promises!
  - **More money in = more granted wishes**. _Make-A-Wish_ effectively _scales_ their operation in proportion to funding. <!-- Their `Charitable Objectives` get fulfilled in a winner-takes-all feedback loop!--> It seems that as they earn funds, they can grant more wishes.
  - This makes them highly influential. People looking to donate (who are unfamiliar with the Charity Sector), simply follow them. <!-- This `Social Proof` means "others know better", they a trusted pair of hands. -->
- Who are our "Micheal Jordans"?
- Do we have a cheerleader to raise the profile of CWB? <!-- Who is our "Greta"? -->
- What should we do with a list of _Movers & Shakers_?
  <!-- - act like a tech-company. Invest in the future via information -->
  - pitch _softly_ about your values and ability to scale.
  - tailor messaging to resonate with causes they support.
  - shape the operation in harmony with relationship building.
  - find ways to have **_impact_ in proportion to _investment_**.
  - carfully tailor the experience of a tiny group of _Movers & Shakers_. <!-- capture their imagination and nudge them into helpping build something next-gen!-->
  - **&hellip;also** meet the needs of `visitors from organic search & social media` and make them feel valued. Give them clear, bite-sized details about the tangible impact of their donation. Solve thier problems from sear engines using easy to comprehend writing: `best charity to support?`, `who's helping Ukraine?` and `tax deductable charities?`.<!--impact understand how we are that trusted pair of hands they are looking for`-->.

##### `Target Audience` segmentation

Let's break this down for `Grant Funders`&hellip;

> üóùÔ∏è Key question: what do Grant Funders look for in an application?

On the surface it looks like they need signals such as `Social Proof`, and want to add detail to the following criteria:

- Alignment. Funders want our goals & values to align with theirs.
- Funders want clear and specific goals.
  - One very effective example is: **More money in = more granted wishes** _Make-A-Wish Foundation_ operation effectively _scales_ in proportion to their capacity.
- Communication. Explain how funding advances CWB's Mission.
- Impact. Evidence of making a real difference.
- Report. We `track` and `measure` our future outcomes.
- Leadership. Demonstrate credability, strong governance <!-- practices --> and the capabilities of an experience team.
- Oversight. Demonstrate responsibility and financial track record.<!--managing resources, accounting and handling risk-->
- Collaborate. Has a history or successful partnerships.
- Sustainment.
